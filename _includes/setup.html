<h3>Overview of the tools</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      While the 2.7 branch is commonly used, we are officially migrating to the 3.6 branch.  All of the packages crucial
      for our purposes have been migrated. Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all in one installer. One of the best is <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda</a> by Continuum Analytics.

    <h4>Jupyter Notebook</h4>
    <p>The <a href="http://http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> is a web-based interface for interactive computing. The Jupyter Notebook
      has support for over 40 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such R, Julia, Scala -  and most importantly, Python. 
      Individual notebooks are composable, executable, and sharable documents 
      that mix text, code, data, and visualizations. The Jupyter Notebook comes pre-loaded
      on many all-in-one python installers like <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda.</a> </p>
    <h4>SQL</h4>
    <p>
      SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases. SQL is a <i>declarative</i> 
      langauge for describing (declaring) the data you want from the database.
      We use <a href="https://sqlitestudio.pl/index.rvt">SQLite Studio</a> for the lessons. There are often memory allocation limits built into most web browsers
      It is a relatively small application with a very intutitive GUI
      We also recomment installing a firefox plugin called 
      <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">SQLite Manager</a>,
      for the lessons. If for some reason SQLLite Studio does not work for you, this will provide a good backup.

      There is no need to install anything.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
      to install it via your distro's package manager
      (e.g. <code>apt-get</code>).
    </p>
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for Linux users.

      from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. Or
      you can use your package manager, e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu
      run <code>apt-get install r-base</code>. Also, please install
      the
      <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio IDE</a>.

    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
      <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
      (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
      comfortable doing the installation yourself just
      download the installer and we'll help you at the boot
      camp.)
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the installer that matches your operating
        system and save it in your home folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open a terminal window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
        tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
        appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press enter. You will follow the text-only
        prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the
        screen press the down arrow to move down through the
        text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
        the license. Press enter to approve the default
        location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to
        your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).

     <h4>Virtual Machine</h4>
    <p>
      Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
      rather than install software on their own computers.
      If your instructors have chosen to do this,
      please:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Download our <a href="{{site.vm_url}}">VM image</a>.
	<strong>Warning:</strong>
	this file is 1.7 GByte,
	so please download it <em>before</em> coming to your bootcamp.
      </li>
      <li>
	Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance"
	and loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
      </li>
    </ol>
