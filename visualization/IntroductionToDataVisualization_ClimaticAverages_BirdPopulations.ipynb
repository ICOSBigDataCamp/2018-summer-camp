    "Welcome to Thursday's data visualization class! Let's take a moment to quickly review what we learned as we get everyone set up - \n",
    "\n",
    "## Within the ICOS Summer Big Data Camp you have learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reviewing - What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a interactive environment (this \"notebook\") where we can explore how a programming language ie Python works. You can \"run\" various cells at a time by hitting shift-enter OR by hitting run after selecting a cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "To edit a cell: double click. \n",
    "To make a text box cell: use the Cell -> Markdown option\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to think of this as a display format which is mixed text like this box and code in the next box - we will be doing the first lab reports using Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reviewing - What is Python and why are we using it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. This means it has 'objects' which have certain rules or methods which you can access to run computer programming. We've seen this as we use pandas dataframes (objects) to analyze data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've used both the command line and Jupyter (through our bulk installation of Anaconda) to read in data from a text file and some basics of Python (the programming commands) for data analysis through utilizing the Jupyter environment (this display).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are we doing TODAY? \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to read in data, look at data, and above all plot data to inform you and your colleagues about said data. All useful things. You will learn and review how to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Read in a CSV (comma seperated data file) into a data format for analysis\n",
    "- Plotting Basics (line plots, bar charts, and colors)\n",
    "- Indexing (simple using .loc and boolean indexing)\n",
    "- Use hex codes for Colors\n",
    "- Use datetime objects\n",
    "- And best of all...create line, bar, and scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "IF AND ONLY IF WE HAVE EXTRA TIME\n",
    "- Create simple legends\n",
    "- Use datetime objects as an index in a Pandas dataframe\n",
    "- How to use Seaborn\n",
    "- Plot many plots, on 1 figure\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab you should be able to: read in simple data from CSV, make a line plot / bar chart, and know that matplotlib (Python's plotting package) is your friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional materials and resources on the data in this lesson for referencing: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The temperature dataset used in this lab is one of the highlighted datasets in the National Climate Asssesment (3rd edition circa 2014. See [Figure 2.2 / 2.3](https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/observed-change)). These are interactive, feel free to click around. The fourth edition part 1 came out recently in [2017](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/front-matter-about/). \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The same data are presented in this figure by [Huber and Knutti, 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1327.pdf). Check out Figure 3, note the similarities and differences in presentation dependent on audience between this paper and the NCA.  \n",

    "#### What is Matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a package that enables visualization and graphics in Python. While we are using Jupyter to demonstrate this package, we will also be saving figures at publication ready formats so that you can see how to use this in your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib like most other Python packages has amazing documentation online. When using Google, always google matplotlib then your search term. You can check it out at the [documentation] (https://matplotlib.org/) online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why are we using it? \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is the basic plotting package for Python. There are several other packages that are availible including the gaining popularity [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) package. Seaborn is useful if you are dealing with some basic stats that you want to show, or some out of the box analysis you want to just run and not deal with the overhead. If we have time in class we will see some of the types of things you can do with Seaborn."
