ICOS Big Data Summer Camp
-------------------------

This is a repository for the ICOS Big Data Summer Camp being held at the University of Michigan from May 14th-18th 2018.

Description: 

Social and organizational life are increasingly conducted online through electronic media, from emails to Twitter feed to dating sites to GPS phone tracking. The traces these activities leave behind have acquired the (misleading) title of “big data.” Within a few years, a standard part of graduate training in the social sciences will include a hefty dose of “using of big data,” and we will all be utilizing terms like API and Python. This year (2018) [ICOS](https://www.icos.umich.edu/about), [MIDAS](http://midas.umich.edu/), and [ARC](http://arc.umich.edu/) are again offering a one-week “big data summer camp” for doctoral students interested in organizational research, with a combination of detailed examples from researchers; hands-on instruction in Python, SQL, and APIs; and group work to apply these ideas to organizational questions.  Enrollment is free, but students must commit to attending all day for each day of camp, and be willing to work in interdisciplinary groups.
